      <p>I'm a web developer, that made my first sites when I was 16. That was 7 years ago, in the mean time I managed to get into Algebra University, where I will get my Certificate for Frontend Development. On Github there is about 7 months of code, my project, that I have build from skrach. Now working in React with Sass and I find that it works great for me.</p>
